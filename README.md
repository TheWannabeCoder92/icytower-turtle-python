# Icy Tower in Python ❄️🕹️

This is a beginner-friendly **Icy Tower–style platformer** built using Python's Turtle Graphics module.

The code is part of a full YouTube tutorial series, where we build the game step by step — covering everything from movement physics and wall bouncing to infinite vertical scrolling, UI, and visual effects.

Follow along to:
- Learn how to simulate physics-based platformer gameplay
- Use Turtle Graphics to draw, animate, and update game elements in real time
- Implement scoring systems, infinite scrolling, and jump effects
- Polish your game with sprite animation and audio feedback

## 📁 Project Structure

```


```

📦 **Note:** 
- `episode07/` contains the final version of the complete game.  
- Sound effects are played using `aplay` (Linux) — you may need to adjust the command for Windows or macOS.  
- Game physics and scoring logic can all be tweaked in `constants.py`.

## 📋 Requirements

No external libraries needed – just Python 3.x.

Make sure `turtle` is available (it's included with standard Python installs).

## ▶️ How to Run

```bash
python main.py
```

The game window will open, and you can start playing Icy Tower using the Right & Left arrow keys to move and Space key to jump.
