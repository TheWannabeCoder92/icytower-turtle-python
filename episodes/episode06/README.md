# 🧮 Episode 6 – Score System, Game Over, & Speed Scaling

In this episode, we introduce a scoring system that tracks how high the player climbs, a game over condition, and dynamic difficulty!

As you reach new heights, the game speeds up — ramping up the challenge the higher you go.

## 🛠️ What We Cover

- ✅ Creating a scoring system that increases as the player reaches new platform heights.
- ✅ Displaying the score on screen using Turtle's drawing tools.
- ✅ Detecting when the player falls below the screen (game over).
- ✅ Increasing scroll speed based on your score to intensify gameplay.

## ▶️ How to Run

Make sure you have Python 3 installed. Then run:

```bash
python main.py
```

You should now see your score increase as you climb — and the game will get faster and more intense with each milestone you hit!
