# 🧱 Episode 2 – Wall & Platform Rendering

Welcome to Episode 2 of the Icy Tower clone tutorial using Python and Turtle Graphics!

In this episode, we expand on our initial setup by rendering the game’s walls and platforms — the key elements the player will bounce between and land on.

---

## 🛠️ What We Cover

- ✅ Creating the `renderer.py` module to handle all drawing logic.
- ✅ Drawing the left and right walls using Turtle.
- ✅ Rendering the initial platforms with consistent spacing.
- ✅ Using constants from `constants.py` for flexible design.
- ✅ Understanding how coordinate placement controls visual layout.

---

## ▶️ How to Run

Make sure you're in the `episode02` folder and run:

```bash
python main.py
```
You should see a black game window with two walls on the sides and several platforms stacked vertically between them.

## 📁 Files Included

- `main.py` – Loads and runs the game loop.
- `constants.py` – Stores layout and size constants.
- `renderer.py` – Responsible for drawing walls and platforms.

In the next episode, we’ll add the **player** and start handling keyboard controls!
