# 🌀 Episode 4 – Physics & Collision

In this episode, we bring our player to life with real-world physics!

We add gravity, implement friction, and make the player interact with the platforms — detecting collisions and allowing safe landings.

---

## 🛠️ What We Cover

- ✅ Adding friction and gravity for smoother movement.
- ✅ Detecting collisions with platforms from above.
- ✅ Allowing jumping only when the player is grounded.

---

## ▶️ How to Run

Make sure you have Python 3 installed. Then run:

```bash
python main.py
```

You should now see the player fall and land on platforms — and jump if you press the spacebar when grounded!

## 📁 Files Included

- `main.py` – Runs the game loop and updates physics each frame.
- `constants.py` – Updated with gravity, jump velocity, and friction values.
- `renderer.py` – Still handles visual layout.
- `actors.py` – Updated with full physics logic, including jumping and collision detection.

In the next episode, we’ll implement **screen scrolling** and recycle platforms to create an infinite tower effect!
