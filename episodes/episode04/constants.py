constants.py â€” Configuration values for the Icy Tower game

This module defines all global constants used throughout the game,
including screen dimensions, object sizes, colors, physics values,
scrolling speeds, and scoring thresholds.

Centralizing constants here improves readability and makes it easier
to tweak gameplay balance or visual settings.
