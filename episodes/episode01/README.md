# 🎮 Episode 1 – Project Setup & Game Structure

Welcome to Episode 1 of the Icy Tower clone series using Python and Turtle Graphics!

In this episode, we lay the foundation for our game by creating the main file, defining constants, and setting up the screen. This structure will support our modular development in future episodes.

---

## 🛠️ What We Cover

- ✅ Creating the main `main.py` file.
- ✅ Setting up the Turtle screen (window size, title, background color).
- ✅ Defining a `main()` function to initialize the game.
- ✅ Writing a `game_loop()` function to handle real-time updates.
- ✅ Creating a `constants.py` file to store game settings like screen size and player properties.
- ✅ Establishing a clean modular structure to build on in future episodes.

## ▶️ How to Run

Make sure you have Python 3 installed. Then run:

```bash
python main.py
```

A black game window will appear — it’s the starting point of our Icy Tower project.

## 📁 Files Included

- `main.py` – The entry point of the game loop and screen setup.
- `constants.py` – Stores core game constants like screen width, height, and player size.

In the next episode, we’ll add the **environment** — drawing the walls and platforms that make up the tower!
