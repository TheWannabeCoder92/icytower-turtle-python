# 🎉 Episode 7 – Final Touches: Graphics, Audio & Effects

Welcome to the **final episode** of our Icy Tower clone in Python!

In this episode, we bring the game to life with custom visuals, sound effects, and a little extra polish to elevate the player experience.

## 🛠️ What We Cover

- ✅ Adding **custom graphics** for the player and platforms.
- ✅ Animating player **rotations** during jumps.
- ✅ Playing a sound when the player jumps.
- ✅ Enhancing the visual feel with **jump stars** and cleaner effects.

## ▶️ How to Run

Make sure you have Python 3 installed, and your `.gif` and `.wav` assets are placed in the same folder as your `.py` files.

Then run:

```bash
python main.py
```

You’ll now see the player spinning mid-air with smooth transitions, colorful platforms, and satisfying jump sounds!

## 🔊 Audio Setup Notes

We use built-in Python tools to play sound effects. The method differs depending on your operating system:

### 🐧 Linux (using `aplay`)
```python
os.system("aplay jump.wav &")
```

### 🪟 Windows (using `winsound`)
```python
import winsound
winsound.PlaySound("jump.wav", winsound.SND_ASYNC)
```
- Import `winsound` module at the top of `main.py`.
- No need to import `os`.

### 🍎 macOS (using `afplay`)
```python
os.system("afplay jump.wav")
```
